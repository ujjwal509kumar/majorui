## Note

The ``` models/ ``` folder was removed from the Git repository because it contained files exceeding GitHub's file size limit (100â€¯MB).

To run the project successfully, please create a folder named models in the root directory and upload the required model files there manually.

Additionally, open the ```app.py``` file and navigate to line 35, where the model is being loaded. You must update the filename there.
